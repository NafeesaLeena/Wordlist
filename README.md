# Wordlist
Wordlist that counts how many times each word appears in a file. The class must use an AVL tree as its underlying representation — vectors, arrays, or other container data structures are not allowed. Note that the Wordlist class is an AVL tree — you should not be implementing the Wordlist class and a separate AVL tree class.
